# Intial Meeting Write Up

### Email to Nick Davies
I've CCed everyone in, just asking to organise an initial meeting.

### Languages
Both the user manuals for the bots suggest using Eclipse and C/C++. As discussed the front end will be Javascript & HTML/CSS using React, Express and Blockly.

### Hackathon
This repo is made with the intention that we do a 1 - 3 day (depending on everyones availability) hackathon for the project. This is not to produce code that we will use in the final product but to just scope out any issues such as integration testing, if middleend is required, etc.
It will also be useful to hash out any of the inevitable issues that arise with group projects like methodologies, assigning work, schedules, etc.
I (Adam) am happy to host this Hackathon at my house and we can order some pizza or whatever rather than being stuck in a room on campus.

### Robots
There are 2 robots Kephera IV and epuck2, both are similar where they have multiple sensors and are little pucks. We'll have things like bluetooth, IR, Wifi, Colour Cameras and I think one even has Lidar so lots of options here.
When I talked to Nick about my dissertation he mentioned the group project would be swarm robotics.

### Swarm Robotics ideas
Need some way that people can program behaviours for swarm robotics so we can do things like implement boids algorithms. Other ideas include football games with a pingpong ball, obstacle course race, mazes, etc.

### Teaching programming
We should also look into the literature of programming education rather than just winging it. That being said some ideas would be to make functions for blockly that can do complex tasks like object avoidance with while conditions like a block to move forward and the until condition being obstacle registed or colour red seen, etc. 
Even though the students will likely only have a few minutes at each outreach program to code we should make it so they can do any programming they want so not limiting, allow for continuous development over a day say where the robots are being shown in a group sandbox and also have samples that they can edit.
